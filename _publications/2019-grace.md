title: "Combining physically based modeling and deep learning for fusing GRACE satellite data: can we learn from mismatch?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-grace
excerpt: 'This was the first work applying DL to GRACE gap filling. Here we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to learn the spatiotemporal residual pattern between TWS anomalies (TWSA) derived from GRACE and those simulated by NOAH, a widely used land surface model. After training, the CNN model can be used w/o GRACE data, thus it is good for gap filling. This paper was one of the first to apply the concept of hybrid model/ML, where data are used to correct model errors.'
