title: "Combining physically based modeling and deep learning for fusing GRACE satellite data: can we learn from mismatch?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-grace
excerpt: ' Here we develop and apply deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to learn the spatiotemporal mismatch between TWS anomalies (TWSA) derived from GRACE and those simulated by NOAH, a widely used land surface model. This paper was one of the first to apply the concept of hybrid ML, where data are used to correct model errors.'
