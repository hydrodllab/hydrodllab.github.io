collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-gnn
excerpt: 'This work presents a multistage, physics-guided, graph neural network (GNN) approach for basin-scale river network learning and streamflow forecasting. The main contributions of this work are (a) we showed to how to model river networks using GNN; (b) we adapted a graph-based data fusion strategy.'
