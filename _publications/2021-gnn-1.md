title: "Explore Spatio-Temporal Learning of Large Sample Hydrology Using Graph Neural Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-gnn-1
excerpt: 'This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using graph neural networks to model a large ensemble of watersheds having different hydroclimatic attributes. Here each watershed can be regarded as a dot and GNN is trained to connect the dots. We showed GraphWavenet achieved the best performance among several GNN and a baseline LSTM model'
