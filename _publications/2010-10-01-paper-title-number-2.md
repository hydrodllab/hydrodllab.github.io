title: "Reconstruction of GRACE total water storage through automated machine learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: ' AutoML represents a new paradigm for optimal algorithm selection, model structure selection, and hyperparameter tuning, addressing some of the most challenging issues in machine learning applications. We demonstrated the workflow over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) using six types of machine learning models and multiple groups of meteorological and climatic variables as predictors. Results indicate that the AutoML‐assisted gap filling achieved satisfactory performance over the CONUS.'
