We present a hybrid flood inundation modeling framework, leveraging the strengths of full Shallow Water Equation (SWE) solvers for high-resolution flood mapping and the flexibility/efficiency of deep learning for nowcasting. Specifically, TRITON, a multi-architecture GPU-enabled, hydrodynamic model open-sourced by Oak National Ridge Lab is used for inundation mapping. TRITON solves the 2D SWE using a time-explicit first order upwind scheme. It incorporates runoff from a distributed hydrological model as sources, and the observed hydrographs as upstream boundary condition. We experimented with several convolutional neural net (CNN) based deep learning models for spatiotemporal modeling, in which the deep learning models are trained using total water depths simulated by TRITON to provide multi-step-forward inundation prediction at hourly steps. The framework was demonstrated over a HUC-8 (i.e., hydrological unit code level 8) coastal river basin in Texas during Hurricane Ike in September 2008. Preliminary results suggest the framework yields robust predictions in terms of critical success index.
