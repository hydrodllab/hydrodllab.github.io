Flood inundation forecast provides critical information for emergency planning before and during flood events. Real time flood inundation forecast tools are still lacking. High-resolution hydrodynamic modeling has become more accessible in recent years, however, predicting flood extents at the street and building levels in real-time is still computationally demanding. Here we present a hybrid process-based and data-driven machine learning (ML) approach for flood extent and inundation depth prediction. We used the Fourier neural operator (FNO), a highly efficient ML method, for surrogate modeling. The FNO model is demonstrated over an urban area in Houston (Texas, U.S.) by training using simulated water depths (in 15-min intervals) from six historical storm events and then tested over two holdout events. Results show FNO outperforms the baseline U-Net model. It maintains high predictability at all lead times tested (up to 3 hrs) and performs well when applying to new sites, suggesting strong generalization skill.
