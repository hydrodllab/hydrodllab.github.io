What we do?
======
Ongoing climate change and anthropogenic activities have imposed signficant challenges on hydroclimatic forecasting at all ranges. The deluge of Earth observation (EO) data adds another layer of complexity. At Hydro Deep Learning Lab, we aim to develop, adapt, and test deep learning algorithms to tackle some of these challenges. 

Major research areas that we are working on
1. Hydrometerological forecasting using AI/ML

1. Hydrogravimetry (GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites) using AI

1. Urban flood inundation mapping using Fourier Neural Operator
